Question 1: Print the sum, difference and product of two complex numbers by creating a class named 'Complex' with separate methods for each operation whose real and imaginary parts are entered by the user.
Solution: 

import java.util.Scanner;

class Complex {
    private double real, imaginary;

    public Complex(double real, double imaginary) {
        this.real = real;
        this.imaginary = imaginary;
    }

    public Complex add(Complex other) {
        return new Complex(this.real + other.real, this.imaginary + other.imaginary);
    }

    public Complex subtract(Complex other) {
        return new Complex(this.real - other.real, this.imaginary - other.imaginary);
    }

    public Complex multiply(Complex other) {
        return new Complex(
            this.real * other.real - this.imaginary * other.imaginary,
            this.real * other.imaginary + this.imaginary * other.real
        );
    }

    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Result: " + real + " + " + imaginary + "i");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter the real part of the first complex number: ");
        double real1 = scanner.nextDouble();
        System.out.print("Enter the imaginary part of the first complex number: ");
        double imaginary1 = scanner.nextDouble();
        Complex complex1 = new Complex(real1, imaginary1);

        System.out.print("Enter the real part of the second complex number: ");
        double real2 = scanner.nextDouble();
        System.out.print("Enter the imaginary part of the second complex number: ");
        double imaginary2 = scanner.nextDouble();
        Complex complex2 = new Complex(real2, imaginary2);

        Complex sum = complex1.add(complex2);
        Complex difference = complex1.subtract(complex2);
        Complex product = complex1.multiply(complex2);

        System.out.println("Sum:");
        sum.display();
        System.out.println("Difference:");
        difference.display();
        System.out.println("Product:");
        product.display();

        scanner.close();
    }
}
